# IoT sensor lab @ Beijing Jiaotong University

The Internet of Things Sensor Lab was established by Dr. Kuanglu Yu (klyu at bjtu dot edu dot cn) in 2017, there are currently two Ph.D. students (one from Tanzania), eight master students, one lab technician, and one associate professor (Dr. Yu). We mainly focus on distributed fiber optical sensors (hardware, our first Phi-OTDR model is able to hear [music](https://github.com/BJTUSensor/BJTUSensor) played 5km away from station), and especially on data processing for those sensors based on SOTA information processing technology (including, machine learning, image and video processing et al).

On GitHub, we share our code, papers, and our dataset, in the hope that we could hold hands with global professors, students, researchers, engineers from both academy and industry to push together forward the application and technology of Distributed fiber optical sensors.

You are welcome to use our codes and dataset for **non-commercial scientific reseach proposes**, but please do mention the their origin (our papers and Github). ***For commercial applications, please contact Dr. Yu for approval.*** (as our contributions are protected by patents)

International enrollment: International applicants for master and Ph.D. degrees are welcome, if you are curiosity driven, self-motivated, and output oriented. We provide a human-orientated, scientifically rich and dynamic environment with no discrimination. Students have opportunities to exchange in domestic/oversea research groups for short or long terms.
