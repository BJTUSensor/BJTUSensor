# IoT sensor lab @ Beijing Jiaotong University
The Internet of Things Sensor Lab was established by Dr. Kuanglu Yu in 2017, there are two Ph.D. students (one from Tanzania), eight master students, one lab technicians, and one associate professor. We mainly focus on distributed fiber optical sensors(hardware, our first Phi-OTDR model is able to hear music 5km away from station), and especially data processing for those sensors based on SOTA information processing technology(including, machine learning, image and video processing et al).

International applicants for master and Ph.D. degrees are welcome, if you are curiosity driven, self-motivated, and output oriented. We provide a human-orientated, scientifically rich and dynamic environment with no discrimination. Students have opportunities to exchange in domestic/oversea research groups for short or long terms.
