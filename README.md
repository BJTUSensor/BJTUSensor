# IoT sensor lab @ Beijing Jiaotong University

The Internet of Things Sensor Lab was established by Dr. Kuanglu Yu in 2017, there are currently two Ph.D. students (one from Tanzania), eight master students, one lab technicians, and one associate professor. We mainly focus on distributed fiber optical sensors(hardware, our first Phi-OTDR model is able to hear [music](https://github.com/BJTUSensor/BJTUSensor) 5km away from station), and especially on data processing for those sensors based on SOTA information processing technology(including, machine learning, image and video processing et al).

On GitHub, we wish to share our code, papers, and our dataset (in preparation), so that we could hold hands with researchers from all over the world to push together forward the application and technology of Distributed fiber optical sensors.

International enrollment: International applicants for master and Ph.D. degrees are welcome, if you are curiosity driven, self-motivated, and output oriented. We provide a human-orientated, scientifically rich and dynamic environment with no discrimination. Students have opportunities to exchange in domestic/oversea research groups for short or long terms.
